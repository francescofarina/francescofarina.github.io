The proposed framework draws inspiration from the learning behavior of human beings, who alternate phases involving collaboration, confrontation and exchange of views with other consisting of studying and learning on their own. On this regard, CL comprises two main phases: a self-training phase in which learning is performed on local private (labeled) data only and a collective training phase in which proxy-labels are assigned to shared (unlabeled) data by means of a consensus-based algorithm. In the considered framework, heterogeneous systems can be connected over the same network, each with different computational capabilities and resources and everyone in the network may take advantage of the cooperation and will eventually reach higher performance with respect to those it can reach on its own. An extensive experimental campaign on an image classification problem emphasizes the properties of CL by analyzing the performance achieved by the cooperating agents.","tags":["preprint"],"title":"Collective Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573205894,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573205894,"objectID":"a212de44449a894fb7f6b3c5ba8ca90f","permalink":"https://francescofarina.github.io/project/disropt/","publishdate":"2019-11-08T10:38:14+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/disropt/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Disropt","type":"project"},{"authors":["Francesco Farina","Stefano Melacci","Andrea Garulli","Antonio Giannitrapani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573167600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573167600,"objectID":"cbc5ec65e627cdd2ee20a53380dab746","permalink":"https://francescofarina.github.io/publication/farina-2019-lfc/","publishdate":"2019-11-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/farina-2019-lfc/","section":"publication","summary":"In this brief, the extension of the framework of Learning from Constraints (LfC) to a distributed setting where multiple parties, connected over the network, contribute to the learning process is studied. LfC relies on the generic notion of ``constraint'' to inject knowledge into the learning problem, and, due to its generality, it deals with possibly nonconvex constraints, enforced either in a hard or soft way. Motivated by recent progresses in the field of distributed and constrained nonconvex optimization, we apply the (distributed) asynchronous method of multipliers (ASYMM) to LfC. The study shows that such a method allows us to support scenarios where selected constraints (i.e., knowledge), data, and outcomes of the learning process can be locally stored in each computational node without being shared with the rest of the network, opening the road to further investigations into privacy-preserving LfC. Constraints act as a bridge between what is shared over the net and what is private to each node, and no central authority is required. We demonstrate the applicability of these ideas in two distributed real-world settings in the context of digit recognition and document classification.","tags":["journal"],"title":"Asynchronous Distributed Learning From Constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Farina","Andrea Camisa","Andrea Testa","Ivano Notarnicola","Giuseppe Notarstefano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572562800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572562800,"objectID":"a67507f0a42ab3735b96afc919fd931b","permalink":"https://francescofarina.github.io/publication/farina-2019-disropt/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/farina-2019-disropt/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we introduce disropt, a Python package for distributed optimization over networks.

In the addressed set-up, the dimension of the decision variable can be extremely high and the objective function can be nonsmooth. The general algorithm consists of two main steps: a consensus step and an update on a single block of the optimization variable, which is then broadcast to neighbors. Three special instances of the proposed method, involving particular problem structures, are then presented. In the general case, the convergence of a dynamic consensus algorithm over random row stochastic matrices is shown. Then, the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal cost is proven in expected value. Exact convergence is achieved when using diminishing (local) stepsizes, while approximate convergence is attained when constant stepsizes are employed. In both cases, the convergence rate is shown to be sublinear. Finally, a numerical example involving a distributed classification problem is provided to corroborate the theoretical results.","tags":["preprint"],"title":"Randomized Block Proximal Methods for Distributed Stochastic Big-Data Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Farina","Andrea Garulli","Antonio Giannitrapani","Giuseppe Notarstefano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554069600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554069600,"objectID":"1f59115207f305b3e8dfee71a2013eb0","permalink":"https://francescofarina.github.io/publication/farina-2019-distributed/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/farina-2019-distributed/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a fully asynchronous and distributed approach for tackling optimization problems in which both the objective function and the constraints may be nonconvex.

In the proposed technique, based on the method of multipliers, each node performs, when it wakes up, either a descent step on a local augmented Lagrangian or an ascent step on the local multiplier vector.

The cost function is the sum of many local submodular functions and each agent in the network has access to one function in the sum only. In this emphdistributed set-up, in order to preserve their own privacy, agents communicate with neighbors but do not share their local cost functions. We propose a distributed algorithm in which agents resort to the Lovàsz extension of their local submodular functions and perform local updates and communications in terms of single blocks of the entire optimization variable. Updates are performed by means of a greedy algorithm which is run only until the selected block is computed, thus resulting in a reduced computational burden. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge in expected value to the optimal cost of the problem, and an approximate solution to the submodular problem is retrieved by a thresholding operation. As an application, we consider a distributed image segmentation problem in which each agent has access only to a portion of the entire image.

The problem becomes challenging when on/off thrusters are employed instead of momentum exchange devices due to, e.g., wheel failures or power limitations. In this case, the attitude control system must enforce an oscillating motion about the setpoint, so as to minimize the switching frequency of the actuators, while guaranteeing a predefined pointing accuracy and rejecting the external disturbances. This paper develops a three-axis attitude control scheme for this problem, accounting for the limitations imposed by the thruster technology. The proposed technique is able to track both the period and the phase of periodic oscillations along the rotational axes, which is instrumental to minimize the switching frequency in the presence of input coupling. Two simulation case studies of a geostationary mission and a low Earth orbit mission are reported, showing that the proposed controller can effectively deal with both constant and time-varying disturbance torques.","tags":["journal"],"title":"Minimum Switching Thruster Control for Spacecraft Precision Pointing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco AND Fontanelli, Daniele AND Garulli, Andrea AND Giannitrapani, Antonio AND Prattichizzo, Domenico Farina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"714b9fa4ced7ad9cc31a2205d1dfd527","permalink":"https://francescofarina.github.io/publication/farina-2017-walking/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/farina-2017-walking/","section":"publication","summary":"Human motion models are finding an increasing number of novel applications in many different fields, such as building design, computer graphics and robot motion planning. The Social Force Model is one of the most popular alternatives to describe the motion of pedestrians. By resorting to a physical analogy, individuals are assimilated to point-wise particles subject to social forces which drive their dynamics. Such a model implicitly assumes that humans move isotropically. On the contrary, empirical evidence shows that people do have a preferred direction of motion, walking forward most of the time. Lateral motions are observed only in specific circumstances, such as when navigating in overcrowded environments or avoiding unexpected obstacles. In this paper, the Headed Social Force Model is introduced in order to improve the realism of the trajectories generated by the classical Social Force Model. The key feature of the proposed approach is the inclusion of the pedestrians’ heading into the dynamic model used to describe the motion of each individual. The force and torque representing the model inputs are computed as suitable functions of the force terms resulting from the traditional Social Force Model. Moreover, a new force contribution is introduced in order to model the behavior of people walking together as a single group. The proposed model features high versatility, being able to reproduce both the unicycle-like trajectories typical of people moving in open spaces and the point-wise motion patterns occurring in high density scenarios. Extensive numerical simulations show an increased regularity of the resulting trajectories and confirm a general improvement of the model realism.","tags":["journal"],"title":"Walking Ahead: The Headed Social Force Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Farina","Daniele Fontanelli","Andrea Garulli","Antonio Giannitrapani","Domenico Prattichizzo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480546800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480546800,"objectID":"5c7d4c57cef10cc12f9ca24213b2d09a","permalink":"https://francescofarina.github.io/publication/farina-2016-helbing/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/farina-2016-helbing/","section":"publication","summary":"The increased diffusion of service robots operating in tight collaboration with humans has renewed the interest of the scientific community towards realistic human motion models.
